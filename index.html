        <p>

            Almost a year ago, our schools closed to prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading between those that attended.
            This movement proved successful, keeping case counts in Palo Alto relatively low, but this all is about to change.
            PAUSD's board has announced that they will offer a revised hybrid model of learning for all students, and to
            accommodate this, all teachers will be forced to return to campus.

        </p>

        <p>

            We know that COVID-19 can have drastic lasting impacts on the lungs of those who contract it, and this motion puts
            our teachers at a much higher risk for contracting the virus. Some teachers may have parents or family living with
            them, for whom COVID-19 can be deadly. Some teachers are out of state because their living situation has changed
            because of the virus. Putting the concern of safety aside, many teachers have concerns that this hybrid model can
            have a negative impact on students' learning. The amount of time given to plan is too short that it is not known
            whether logistics can be figured out in time for students to return. For these reasons, we write the board to try
            to get them to reconsider their timeframe for reopening and delay it further to increase the safety of and the planning
            behind this operation.
