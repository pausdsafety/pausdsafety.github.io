Dear School Board Members,

While we do understand the concerns about students’ mental health from lack of social interaction, it is extremely concerning that teachers would be forced to return to accommodate the students that wish to come back to school.

There are many worries expressed by teachers and shared by students.

-    Concerns around health and safety of teachers and students
    -    There will likely be a higher concentration of students on campus
    -    It is harder to monitor distancing when students are spread out during breaks
    -    Teachers will most likely not get their vaccines before returning to school
-    Lack of forewarning for teachers who need to change their lifestyle to return
    -    Less than a month’s worth of notice may not be enough for teachers that need to make large changes to their current living situation.
-    A downgrade in the quality of education for many students
    -    It gets harder to have private conversations with students
    -    From the experience of students currently zooming from school, it’s hard to be the only one talking when no one else in the room understands the context.
    -    Even if teachers were teaching both an in person and electronically present classroom, most teachers feel that they would accidentally ignore their zoom audience.

I am genuinely concerned about my teachers, considering that the vaccination process will most likely not get to them by the time they are to return to school. If it means that our teachers would get a choice between teaching over zoom or in the classroom, I am willing to stay home and get my social interaction through other means such as meeting up and following safety protocol with a much smaller group of friends outside of school.

Sincerely,
A concerned PAUSD student
